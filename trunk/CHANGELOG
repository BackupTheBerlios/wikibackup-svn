	*WikiBackup.php: Added more comments.

	Changed hook so user is notified when backup completes, not at login.

	*WikiBackup.php (53): Changed hook from "UserLoginComplete" to "ArticleViewHeader"
	*WikiBackup.php (83): Changed function to adapt to new hook.

	Fixed parser function so URL to backup download is correct.

	*WikiBackup.php (BackupParserRender): Added global variables $wgServer and $wgScriptPath to URL.

	Fixed parser function so displaytext defaults to URL instead of blank, which would just generate a number.

	*WikiBackup.php (BackupParserRender): Changed if statement to check if displaytext is blank, and set it to the URL if blank.
